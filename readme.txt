== Description ==

Intelligent recommendations use predictive analytics to recommend items and services to customers based on their past behaviours, preferences, and interests. They are used by businesses to increase customer engagement, provide a more personalised experience, and improve customer retention. Intelligent recommendations can be based on data from customer surveys, browsing behaviours, and purchase histories, as well as other sources of customer data. They are often implemented as part of a larger customer relationship management system, and have been shown to be effective in increasing customer satisfaction, loyalty, and revenue.

Product recommendations are a critical aspect of any retailer’s ecommerce strategy. Smart recommendations help customers find relevant products at lower costs. A product recommended at the right time can influence buying of a product over another. Product recommendations can help boost sales and, thereby, profits too.

In a traditional search system, the objective is to return results that are similar to a query object in one dimension or multiple dimensions based on product features. Recommendations added differentiate and personalise across queries based-on user behaviour analytics.

Ecommerce businesses must keep customers interested long enough for purchase decisions to be made. They must make suitable recommendations to keep customers interested. In fact, smart recommendations can stimulate impulse purchases too.

A study shows that product recommendations account for one-third of online revenue and can reduce cart abandonment by 4.35%. Leading ecommerce sites acknowledge that over 30% of their revenue is earned from purchase of recommended products.

Warp Driven Recommendation System would help improve your website conversion rate, get more recurring visitors, make longer user sessions and know what your visitors are looking for.

- **Improved User Experience**: With user behaviors based and visually similar recommendations, customers enjoy a superior and personalised online shopping experience.
- **Increased Conversion Rates**: Relevant product suggestions help users find what they’re looking for, driving higher conversions and sales.
- **Enhanced Customer Retention**: By providing tailored recommendations, the system promotes customer satisfaction and fosters brand loyalty.
- **More Efficient Stock Management**: Insights on customer preferences can optimise inventory planning and management.
- **Seamlessly integration with supply chain system**: allowing merchants list recommended products based on ccustomer preferences directly from our supply chain.

**Target Audience**: Our application caters to a broad spectrum of merchants, with optimal results observed for stores boasting 100+ products and a monthly visits count exceeding 100,000. Notably, our Visually Similar Recommendations feature stands out, making it particularly advantageous for fashion, furniture, and visually-oriented shops, thereby boosting conversion rates.

**Pricing Structure**: Currently, there is no upfront fee for merchants. We operate on a post-payment model, collecting a monthly commission of approximately 5% based on the item's sale price as recommended through our widgets.

This plugin would show the intelligent recommendations or visually similar recommendations on product detail page with a widget on the page bottom.

   b. Fill in the Data Server Key (this is not mandatory, but the data dashboard function depends on it).

   c. Turn off Test mode.

### Additional information:

#### Regarding the Recommendation API Key

You can find it at <https://warpdriven.ai/connection/my-connection/>. Please note that if you have connected multiple websites on our platform, the Recommendation API Key for each website is different and cannot be used interchangeably.

#### Regarding the Data Server Key

By default, we do not generate a Data Server Key when establishing a connection with your website, so you cannot obtain it in the same way as the Recommendation API Key. Please contact us at <https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/> to obtain it.

#### Regarding Test mode

The main function of this plugin is to add a product recommendation component to your product detail pages. If you want to view the functionality of the recommendation component without disturbing buyers, enable Test mode. When Test mode is enabled, the recommendation component will only work when the browser address bar's query parameter includes wd_demo=true.

#### For example

- When Test mode is enabled:

    <https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug>, the recommendation component will not be displayed.
    <https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?wd_demo=true>, the recommendation component will be displayed as usual.
    <https://yourstore.com/product/product-slug?else_search=else_value&wd_demo=true>, the recommendation component will be displayed as usual.

- When Test mode is disabled:

    The recommendation component will be displayed to buyers only if you have correctly filled in the Recommendation API Key, and your products have been initialized successfully.

#### Regarding Custom Data Server

By default, the functionality of recommendation components on all websites is centrally stored on the same server. If you, for security reasons or to customize the recommendation algorithm for your products, want us to handle your data separately, please contact us at <https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/> to obtain it.

#### Regarding Custom JS

By default, the style of the recommendation component may not match your website's design, or you may need some more advanced features. If you want us to customize the product recommendation component specifically for your website, please contact us at <https://warpdriven.ai/ticket/> to obtain it.

- Choose all product categories you preferred, then click the start button to init the products with WarpDriven Recommender API.
